### Quantum Phase Estimation
For week 18 oct ~ 24 oct, I would like to talk about _Quantum Phase Estimation_. It is a critical promising subroutine for quantum algorithms. My apologies, but due to my limited time I won't be able to write full details here. However, We might discuss in details during the presentation. Here are some useful links,
